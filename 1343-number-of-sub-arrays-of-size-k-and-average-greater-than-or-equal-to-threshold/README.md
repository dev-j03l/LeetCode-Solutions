## Problem Description

Given an array of integers 
arr
 and two integers 
k
 and 
threshold
, return 
the number of sub-arrays of size 
k
 and average greater than or equal to 
threshold
.


 


Example 1:




Input:
 arr = [2,2,2,2,5,5,5,8], k = 3, threshold = 4

Output:
 3

Explanation:
 Sub-arrays [2,5,5],[5,5,5] and [5,5,8] have averages 4, 5 and 6 respectively. All other sub-arrays of size 3 have averages less than 4 (the threshold).



Example 2:




Input:
 arr = [11,13,17,23,29,31,7,5,2,3], k = 3, threshold = 5

Output:
 6

Explanation:
 The first 6 sub-arrays of size 3 have averages greater than 5. Note that averages are not integers.



 


Constraints:




1 <= arr.length <= 10
5


1 <= arr[i] <= 10
4


1 <= k <= arr.length


0 <= threshold <= 10
4
