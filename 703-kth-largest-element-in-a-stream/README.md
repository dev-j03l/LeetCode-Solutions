## Problem Description

You are part of a university admissions office and need to keep track of the 
kth
 highest test score from applicants in real-time. This helps to determine cut-off marks for interviews and admissions dynamically as new applicants submit their scores.


You are tasked to implement a class which, for a given integer 
k
, maintains a stream of test scores and continuously returns the 
k
th highest test score 
after
 a new score has been submitted. More specifically, we are looking for the 
k
th highest score in the sorted list of all scores.


Implement the 
KthLargest
 class:




KthLargest(int k, int[] nums)
 Initializes the object with the integer 
k
 and the stream of test scores 
nums
.


int add(int val)
 Adds a new test score 
val
 to the stream and returns the element representing the 
k
th
 largest element in the pool of test scores so far.




 


Example 1:




Input:


["KthLargest", "add", "add", "add", "add", "add"]

[[3, [4, 5, 8, 2]], [3], [5], [10], [9], [4]]


Output:
 
[null, 4, 5, 5, 8, 8]


Explanation:


KthLargest kthLargest = new KthLargest(3, [4, 5, 8, 2]);

kthLargest.add(3); // return 4

kthLargest.add(5); // return 5

kthLargest.add(10); // return 5

kthLargest.add(9); // return 8

kthLargest.add(4); // return 8




Example 2:




Input:


["KthLargest", "add", "add", "add", "add"]

[[4, [7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 3]], [2], [10], [9], [9]]


Output:
 
[null, 7, 7, 7, 8]


Explanation:

KthLargest kthLargest = new KthLargest(4, [7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 3]);

kthLargest.add(2); // return 7

kthLargest.add(10); // return 7

kthLargest.add(9); // return 7

kthLargest.add(9); // return 8

1 <= k <= nums.length + 1
